        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <h3>Background</h3>

        <p>Madagascar was one of the last major habitable landmasses on earth
           settled by humans. While there is some evidence of human presence on the
           island in the millennia B.C., large-scale settlement began between A.D.
           350 and 550 with settlers from present-day Indonesia. The island
           attracted Arab and Persian traders as early as the 7th century, and
           migrants from Africa arrived around A.D. 1000.</p>

        <p>Madagascar was a pirate stronghold during the late 17th and early 18th
          centuries, and served as a slave trading center into the 19th century.
          From the 16th to the late 19th century, a native Merina Kingdom dominated
          much of Madagascar. The island was conquered by the French in 1896 who
          made it a colony; independence was regained in 1960.</p>

        <p>During 1992-93, free presidential and National Assembly elections were
          held ending 17 years of single-party rule. In 1997, in the second presidential
           race, Didier RATSIRAKA, the leader during the 1970s and 1980s, returned to the
           presidency. The 2001 presidential election was contested between the followers
           of Didier RATSIRAKA and Marc RAVALOMANANA, nearly causing secession of half of the country.</p>

        <p> In 2002, the High Constitutional Court announced RAVALOMANANA the winner.
          RAVALOMANANA won a second term in 2006 but, following protests in 2009, handed over
          power to the military, which then conferred the presidency on the mayor of Antananarivo,
          Andry RAJOELINA, in what amounted to a coup d'etat. Following a lengthy mediation process
          led by the Southern African Development Community, Madagascar held UN-supported presidential
          and parliamentary elections in 2013.</p>

        <p>Former de facto finance minister Hery RAJAONARIMAMPIANINA won a runoff election in
          December 2013 and was inaugurated in January 2014. In January 2019, RAJOELINA was
          declared the winner of a runoff election against RAVALOMANANA; both RATSIRAKA and
          RAJAONARIMAMPIANINA also ran in the first round of the election, which took place in November 2018.</p>
