        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <article>
          <h3>Background</h3>

          <p>Madagascar was one of the last major habitable landmasses on earth
               settled by humans. While there is some evidence of human presence on the
               island in the millennia B.C., large-scale settlement began between A.D.
               350 and 550 with settlers from present-day Indonesia. The island
               attracted Arab and Persian traders as early as the 7th century, and
               migrants from Africa arrived around A.D. 1000.</p>

          <p>Madagascar was a pirate stronghold during the late 17th and early 18th
            centuries, and served as a slave trading center into the 19th century.
            From the 16th to the late 19th century, a native Merina Kingdom dominated
            much of Madagascar. The island was conquered by the French in 1896 who
            made it a colony; independence was regained in 1960.</p>

          <p>During 1992-93, free presidential and National Assembly elections were
            held ending 17 years of single-party rule. In 1997, in the second presidential
             race, Didier RATSIRAKA, the leader during the 1970s and 1980s, returned to the
             presidency. The 2001 presidential election was contested between the followers
             of Didier RATSIRAKA and Marc RAVALOMANANA, nearly causing secession of half of the country.</p>

          <p> In 2002, the High Constitutional Court announced RAVALOMANANA the winner.
            RAVALOMANANA won a second term in 2006 but, following protests in 2009, handed over
            power to the military, which then conferred the presidency on the mayor of Antananarivo,
            Andry RAJOELINA, in what amounted to a coup d'etat. Following a lengthy mediation process
            led by the Southern African Development Community, Madagascar held UN-supported presidential
            and parliamentary elections in 2013.</p>

          <p>Former de facto finance minister Hery RAJAONARIMAMPIANINA won a runoff election in
            December 2013 and was inaugurated in January 2014. In January 2019, RAJOELINA was
            declared the winner of a runoff election against RAVALOMANANA; both RATSIRAKA and
            RAJAONARIMAMPIANINA also ran in the first round of the election, which took place in November 2018.</p>
