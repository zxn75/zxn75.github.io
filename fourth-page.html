          <p>Join the main character to try and "catch em all". The Nintendo Switch has
          changed the games of pokemon a lot but all for the better. Battle other pokemon
          trainers to fight for a chance at becoming the best of them. The pokemon games
          have pokemon that we all know and love including pikachu, squirtle, and many more. </p>
